        For all correct picks you get that round's points <em>plus</em>
        the seed number of the team. So, if you pick the 10th-seed
        team to win the 3rd-round, that would be 13 points if correct.

      <h3>Tie Breaker</h3>
      <div>
        In case of a tie will broken in the following order
      </div>
      <ol>
        <li>Closest "tiebreaker" to the total score (both teams) added together in the final game</li>
        <li>Correct team picked for winner</li>
        <li>Correct overall number of picks</li>
      </ol>
      <div>
        If two brackets are still tied after this, they split the winnings.
